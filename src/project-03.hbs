      <p class="body-text">Living in an era when mobile data is vital to peopleâ€™s everyday life, residents in some African countries still consider it a luxury to get mobile data, the price of which is out of reach for those living on an average salary. </p>
      <p class="body-text">The Alliance for Affordable Internet, a global coalition working towards affordable broadband with Google being one of its sponsors, recently released the data about mobile data prices in 99 low- and middle-income countries.</p>
      <p class="body-text">The rates included in this report refer specifically to the price of 1GB of broadband data over a 30-day period based on the cheapest plans of the largest mobile network operator in each country.</p>
